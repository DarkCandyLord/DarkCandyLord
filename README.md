*I build tools for people who run imaginary worlds.*

I'm a solo dev from a small town who keeps making TTRPG tools because I keep finding things that don't exist yet. Seven apps and counting. Each one started as "I wish someone would build this" and ended as "fine, I'll do it myself."

These aren't just for D&D Dungeon Masters — they're for GMs, players, worldbuilders, writers, solo RPG journalers, actual play hosts, and anyone else whose brain won't stop generating fictional places and the people who live in them. If you run a world in any system, something here is probably useful to you.

## The Toolkit

| | Tool | What It's For |
|---|------|-------------|
| :crossed_swords: | **[Saga](https://github.com/DarkCandyLord/saga)** | Everything about your campaign in one place — characters, sessions, timelines, dice, initiative — instead of scattered across three notebooks and a spreadsheet |
| :hammer_and_pick: | **[Loreforge](https://github.com/DarkCandyLord/loreforge)** | Worldbuilding with structure but no autopilot. 30 prompts across 6 categories. No AI. Your words, your world |
| :spider_web: | **[Intrigue](https://github.com/DarkCandyLord/intrigue)** | Map who knows who and why it matters. Interactive network graph for NPCs, factions, alliances, and secrets |
| :scroll: | **[Oath](https://github.com/DarkCandyLord/oath)** | Start campaigns right. Session zero wizard for tone, safety tools, house rules, and what everyone actually expects |
| :world_map: | **[Outlands](https://github.com/DarkCandyLord/outlands)** | Paint a hex map, fill it with encounters, and run exploration. For hex crawls and overland travel in any system |
| :balance_scale: | **[Favor](https://github.com/DarkCandyLord/favor)** | Track faction politics. Reputation heatmap so you always know where every character stands with every faction |
| :studio_microphone: | **[Voicecraft](https://github.com/DarkCandyLord/voicecraft)** | Give every NPC a distinct voice and actually remember it next session. Dialect mixing, coaching prompts, sample lines |

All system-agnostic. D&D, Pathfinder, Mothership, Blades in the Dark, your homebrew — the tools don't care about your edition.
